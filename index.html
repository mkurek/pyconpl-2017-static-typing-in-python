<!-- ==================== PEP484 ==================== -->

# PEP484

* Everything started from PEP3107 - introduced in Python 3.0

???
As you probably know every (major) change in python comes through PEP - Python Enhancement Proposal - it couldn't be different this time - it's one of the biggest changes in Python syntax from the very beginning.<br><br>

Rationale:<br>
* Python's 2.x lacks a standard way of annotating a function's parameters and return values<br>
* variety of tools and libraries tried to fill this gap.<br>
  ** Some utilise the decorators<br>
  ** others parse a function's docstring, looking for annotations there.<br><br>

This PEP aims to provide a <b>single, standard way</b> of specifying this information, reducing the confusion caused by the wide variation in mechanism and syntax that has existed until this point.<br><br>

<hr>
<b>Semantic was, intentionally, not defined</b> - although no meaning was assigned to annotations then, there has always been an implicit goal to use them for <b>type hinting</b>, which is listed as the first possible use case in PEP 3107.<br><br>

Introduced in 2008. After 7 years, in 2015, type-hints were introduced in Python 3.5.<br><br>
<hr>
mypy - created in 2012r, Jukka Lehtosalo - it's THE optional static type checker for python - I'll talk about it later<br><br>

The type system supports unions, <b>generic types</b>, and a special type named <b>Any</b> which is consistent with (i.e. assignable to and from) all types<br><br>

This PEP aims to provide a standard syntax for type annotations, opening up Python code to easier <b>static analysis</b> and <b>refactoring</b>, <b>potential runtime type checking</b>, and (perhaps, in some contexts) code generation utilizing type information.<br><br>
<hr>
Python will still remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory, even by convention - these are only type <b>hints</b>. <br><br>


--

* PEP3107 introduced syntax for function annotations, but the semantics were left undefined

```
def testFunc(source: expression, target: expression) -> expression:
  ...
```

--

* PEP484 - the next step in standarization of annotations and tools:

  * greatly inspired and based on `mypy`

  * aims to provide a standard syntax for type annotations

  * the most important goal wat potential static analysis

  * **but** Python will still remain a dynamically typed language

# The Old (Conservative) Way

```
def greeting(name):
    """
    Say hello

    Args:
      name (str): name to say hello

    Returns:
      str: The greeting

```

???
1. google style (it does not exclude type annotations - types could be ommited in docstring)

2. sphinx, rst

lot of drawbacks:
* repeating param name
* in 2: multiline for context and type
* hard to read
* potential inconsistency between actual parameters and docstring

**Cure: type hints**
--

```
def greeting(name):
    """
    Say hello

    :param name: name to say hello
    :type name: str

    :return: The greeting

<!-- ==================== Type hints syntax ==================== -->

# Type hints: Syntax

python3
```
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
```

???
type hinting is used by **filling function annotation slots with classes**

Expressions whose type is a subtype of a specific argument type are also accepted for that argument.

Right now just syntax and types which are result of PEP484
<hr>
py2: Docstring always comes after the type comment.


--

python2
```
def greeting(name):
  # type: (str) -> str
  """Docstring comes after type comment."""
  return 'Hello ' + name
```

or

```
def greeting(
  name,  # type: str
):
  # type: (...) -> str
  return 'Hello ' + name
```

literal string formatting in python 3.6

<hr>

type hints for variables

for str no need to provide type - it would be infered as str
--

python<=3.5
```
foo = []  # type: List[int]
bar = "abc"  # type: str
```

python3.6
```
foo: List[int] = []
bar: str = "abc"
```

# Type hints: Kinds of types

Acceptable type hints:

* built-in classes

* abstract base classes

* types available in the `types` module, ex. `IntType`, `SliceType`, `FunctionType`

* user-defined classes

* special constructs (available in `typing` module):
  * `None`, `Any`, `Union`, `Callable`
  * `Sequence`, `Tuple`, `List`, `Mapping`, `Dict`
  * type variables and type aliases

???
ABC

py2: `pip install typing`

-

Annotations must be valid expressions that **evaluate without raising exceptions** at the time the function is defined.

-

type variables - for generics

-

The following examples will consider Python3, but all of these concepts are
applicable to Python2 as well, but with comments used instead of function
annotations syntax

<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Special constructs

* Any

```
def greeting(name: Any) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + str(name)
```

???

Note that Any and builtin type object are completely different.

<hr>

Union: small, limited set of expected types for a single argument

--

```
greeting("Mateusz")
greeting(1)
greeting([1, 2, 3])
```

--

* Union

```
MyItem = Union[int, str]


def increase(x: MyItem) -> MyItem:
    if isinstance(x, str):
        return x + 'a'
    else:
        return x + 1
```

--

```
increase(1)
increase("abc")
```

---

<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Optional

```
from typing import Optional

def greeting(name: Optional[str]) -> str:
    if name:
        return 'Hello, {}'.format(name)
    else:
        return 'Hello, stranger'
```

???
An optional type is also automatically assumed when the default value is None



--

```
def greeting(name: Union[str, None]) -> str:
  ...
```

--

```
def greeting(name: str = None) -> str:
  ...
```

---
class: with-title
<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Callables

```
def apply_callbacks(cbs: List[Callable]) -> None:
  for callback in cbs:
    callback()
```

???
It is possible to declare the return type of a callable without specifying the call signature by substituting a literal ellipsis (three dots) for the list of arguments:

Since using callbacks with keyword arguments is not perceived as a common use case, there is currently **no support for specifying keyword arguments** with Callable. Similarly, there is **no support for specifying callback signatures with a variable number of argument** of a specific type.

--

```
def partial(func: Callable[[int, str], str], *args) -> Callable[[int, str], str]:
    # body
```

--

```
def partial(func: Callable[..., str], *args) -> Callable[..., str]:
    # body
```

---
class: with-title
<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Iterables


* Sequence

```
def first(x: Sequence[int]) -> int:
    return x[0]
```

???

Usually it’s a better idea to use **Sequence[T]** instead of Tuple[T, ...], as Sequence is also compatible with lists and other non-tuple sequences.

<hr>

iterable vs sequence: sequence inherits from iterable (adds len etc)

<hr>

Tuple without args: Tuple[Any]

<hr>

If t2 is a subtype of t1, then a generic type constructor GenType is called:

Covariant, if GenType[t2] is a subtype of GenType[t1] for all such t1 and t2.
Contravariant, if GenType[t1] is a subtype of GenType[t2] for all such t1 and t2.
Invariant, if neither of the above is true.

--

* List

```
def last(t: List[int]) -> int:
    return r[-1]
```

--

* Tuple

```
def add(t: Tuple[int, float]) -> float:
    return t[0] + t[1]
add((2.0, 5))  # error!
```

--

```
def greater_than(t: Tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
    return tuple(x for x in t if x > n)

greater_than((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), 3)
```

---
class: with-title
<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Mappings

* Mapping

```
def keys(m: Mapping[int, str])-> List[int]:
    return list(m.keys())
```
???

could use DefaultDict  too


--

* Dict

```
def sum_of_values(d: Dict[str, int]) -> int:
  return sum(d.values())
```

---
class: with-title
<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - special constructs ================= -->

# Type hints: Generics

```
from typing import TypeVar

MyType = TypeVar('MyType')  # Can be anything
```

???
**GENERICS!**

Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type checkers. They serve as the parameters for **generic types** as well as for **generic function definitions**.

all user-defined generics are invariant

--

```
Number = TypeVar('Number', int, float, complex)  # Must be int or float or complex
```

--

```
def repeat(x: MyType, n: int) -> Sequence[MyType]:
    return [x] * n
```

--

```
def largest(x: Number, y: Number) -> Number:
    return x if x >= y else y
```

--

```
largest(1, 2)  # ok
largest(1.0, 2.0)  # ok
largest(1, 2.0)  # error!
```

--

```
isinstance(1, Number)  # TypeError!
issubclass(int, Number)  # True
```

---
class: with-title
<!-- ================= Type hints syntax - generics ================= -->
# Type hints: Generics

```
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

class Stack(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Create an empty list with items of type T
        self.items: List[T] = []

    def push(self, item: T) -> None:
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> T:
        return self.items.pop()

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.items
```

???
GENERICS!

interesting way to initialize typed generic [int]

variable type in python 3.6

self does not have to be annotated!

<hr>

Type error only during mypy check, not during runtime

--

```
stack = Stack[int]()
stack.push(2)
stack.pop()
stack.push('x')        # Type error
```

???

`T` is always the same

from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

class Node(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, label: T = None) -> None:
        ...
    x = None  # type: T

x = Node('')  # Inferred type is Node[str]
y = Node(0)   # Inferred type is Node[int]
z = Node()    # Inferred type is Node[Any]
```


???
type is inferred from passed param

In case the inferred type uses [Any] but the intended type is more specific, you can use a type comment (see below) to force the type of the variable

<hr>

Alternatively, you can instantiate a specific concrete type

<hr>

Runtime type (class) is still Node; type erasure

--

```
a = Node()    # type: Node[int]
```

--

```
b = Node[int]()
```

???

That's all about syntax.

What about exceptions? This part is not covered by PEP484 and typ hints does not support potential raised exceptions (like throws in Java) - the only thing that this PEP suggests is to put them into docstrings/documentation.
--

* explicit types

```
x: Union[int, str] = 1
```

--

* The static types described in PEP 484, should not be confused with the runtime classes

  * `int` is a class and a type
  * `UserID` is a class and a type
  * `Union[str, int]` is a type but not a proper class

<!-- ================= mypy ================= -->

# mypy

* **optional** static type checker

* external tool - not part of the language

* non-runtime checking - it's (another) lint-like tool

* all errors reported by mypy are essentially warnings that you are free to ignore

* still experimental...

???
As mypy is a static analyzer, or a lint-like tool, your code’s type annotations are **just hints** and don’t interfere when running your program. You run your program with a standard Python interpreter, and the annotations are treated primarily as comments.

Mypy is still experimental. There will be changes that break backward compatibility.

You may wonder, how can a type checker predict that a type error will occur when a particular program is run? The answer is that it can’t. It is impossible to build a type checker that can predict in general which programs will result in type errors and which will not. (This is equivalent to the well-known halting problem.) Instead, all type checkers make a conservative approximation of what will happen during execution and give error messages for anything that might cause a type error.

<!-- ================= mypy config ================= -->
# mypy: Configuration

* Support CLI flags or configuration file

???

**None is a valid value for every type**, which resembles null in Java. Unlike Java, mypy doesn’t treat primitives types specially: **None is also valid for primitive types such as int and float**.

--

* Interesting options:
  * `strict_optional` - strict checking of `Optional[...]` types and `None` values
  * `ignore_missing_imports` - suppress error messages about imports that cannot be resolved
  * `disallow_untyped_defs` - disallows defining functions without type annotations or with incomplete type annotations
  * `disallow_any` - disallow various types of `Any`

--

* mypy.ini:

```
[mypy]
python_version = 3.5
disallow_untyped_defs = True
ignore_missing_imports = True
strict_optional = True

[mypy-*/tests/*,*.tests.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = False
```

# Summary

* static typing can make programs easier to understand and maintain.

???
Documentation is important as **code is typically read much more often than modified**, and this is especially important for large and complex programs.

* Dynamic typing can be perfect for a small project or for writing the UI of your program, for example. As your program grows, you can adapt tricky application logic to static typing to help maintenance.

* When its suitable?
Your project is large or complex.
Your codebase must be maintained for a long time.
Multiple developers are working on the same code.
Running tests takes a lot of time or work (type checking may help you find errors early in development, reducing the number of testing iterations).

--

* works in Python 2 and Python 3

--

* gradual typing - easy to introduce step-by-step

--

* type declarations can serve as machine-checked documentation

--

* suitable for large projects

--

* benefits of both dynamic and static typing in a single language

---

class: center, middle, title-slide
# Type hints: hate or love?

???

There is a religious war between people who think dynamic checking is better and people who think static type checking is better. I believe that one of the reasons why this war has gone on for so long is that both groups have good points.
